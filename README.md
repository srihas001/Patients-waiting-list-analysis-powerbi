# Patient Waiting List Analytics Dashboard 🏥

> A Power BI project designed to solve real-world healthcare bottlenecks by identifying waitlist delays across age groups, case types, and medical specialties. Built with a focus on business problem-solving, operational efficiency, and patient-centered insights.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze patient waitlist trends using interactive Power BI dashboards — with the goal of helping hospitals identify critical delays, prioritize care, and improve overall service delivery through data-driven planning.

---

## 💼 Business Problem

As patient volumes grow, hospitals struggle to monitor and act on delays across thousands of waitlist entries.  
Manual systems fail to flag aging patients, high-demand specialties, or seasonal load surges in real-time.

This leads to:
- ⏳ Increased wait times and patient dissatisfaction  
- 🩺 Inequitable access for vulnerable groups (like the elderly)  
- ⚠️ Missed performance benchmarks and service bottlenecks

---

## ✅ Solution Approach

- Built a **real-time Power BI dashboard** with dynamic filters (case type, age group, specialty, time period)
- Used **Excel** for data preprocessing and transformation
- Created toggles for comparing **average vs median** wait times to spot skew
- Proposed **actionable strategies** for operational and policy improvements

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – DAX Measures, Visual Design, Slicers, Drilldowns  
- **Excel** – Data Cleaning, Structuring  
- **Data Storytelling** – Clear KPIs, trend visuals, and recommendations  
- **UX Design** – Real-time interactivity for decision-making

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- Covers **Jan 2018 – Mar 2021** hospital waitlist records  
- Fields include:  
  - **Case Type:** Outpatient, Inpatient, Day Case  
  - **Time Band:** 0–3M, 3–6M, ..., 15–18M  
  - **Age Group:** 0–15, 16–64, 65+  
  - **Specialty:** Cardiology, Dermatology, ENT, etc.  
  - **Metrics:** Patient count, Avg/Median wait time

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Outpatients** make up ~74% of the total waitlist  
- **65+ age group** faces the longest wait times — especially in 18+ month bands  
- **Paediatric Dermatology** & **ENT** show the highest average delays  
- **Post-2019 outpatient volume** rose sharply, while inpatient cases declined  
- **Certain specialties** consistently exceed acceptable wait thresholds

---

## 📌 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Prioritize High-Wait Specialties  
- **Insight:** Dermatology & Orthopaedics experience persistent delays  
- **Action:** Increase appointment slots and cross-utilize capacity  
- **Impact:** Reduces service overload and patient backlog  

### 2. Flag At-Risk Age Groups  
- **Insight:** 65+ patients suffer longest delays  
- **Action:** Implement age-priority triage logic  
- **Impact:** Improves outcomes and care equity  

### 3. Plan for Outpatient Surge  
- **Insight:** Outpatient demand shows year-on-year growth  
- **Action:** Introduce flexible scheduling or popup clinics  
- **Impact:** Avoids strain during seasonal spikes  

### 4. Operationalize the Dashboard  
- **Insight:** Filters by case, specialty, and date help real-time review  
- **Action:** Integrate into hospital admin workflow  
- **Impact:** Faster reactions, better resource deployment
