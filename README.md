# Patient Waiting List Analytics Dashboard ðŸ“ˆ

> A healthcare-focused data visualization project using Power BI & Excel to analyze patient waitlist patterns, delays, and operational bottlenecks across age groups, specialties, and case types â€” with actionable insights to improve healthcare delivery.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

To analyze patient waitlist trends across age groups, specialties, and case types using Power BI â€” aiming to identify high-pressure areas, service delays, and strategic improvements in hospital operations.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboarding, DAX Measures, interactive UX  
- **Excel** â€“ Data cleaning & structuring  
- **UX for Decision-Making** â€“ Filters, slicers, date sliders, toggle for Avg vs Median  
- **Data Storytelling** â€“ Visual layout, KPI interpretation, actionable recommendations

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

- Patient waitlist data from **Jan 2018 to Mar 2021**
- Key fields include:  
  - `Case Type:` Outpatient, Inpatient, Day Case  
  - `Age Profile:` 0â€“15, 16â€“64, 65+  
  - `Time Bands:` 0â€“3M, 3â€“6M, ..., 15â€“18M  
  - `Specialty Name:` Emergency, Dermatology, Cardiology, etc.  
  - `Metrics:` Waitlist count, average & median wait times

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Outpatient** cases dominate with over **70%** of the total waitlist  
- **65+ age group** patients face the **longest delays**, especially in 18+ month bands  
- **Paediatric Dermatology** & **ENT** departments have the **highest average waits**  
- **Day Case & Inpatient** volumes dipped notably in **2020â€“21**  
- **Outpatient trends** show a consistent increase from 2019 to 2021

## ðŸ“Œ Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Prioritize High-Wait Specialties  
- **Insight:** Dermatology and Orthopaedics show persistent delays  
- **Action:** Allocate additional slots or optimize referrals  
- **Impact:** Reduces bottlenecks and wait times

### 2. Address Elderly Patient Delay  
- **Insight:** 65+ patients experience long waitlists  
- **Action:** Implement age-priority triaging in scheduling  
- **Impact:** Improves service equity and outcomes for vulnerable groups

### 3. Monitor Outpatient Growth  
- **Insight:** Outpatient load increased over years  
- **Action:** Expand capacity or stagger appointments  
- **Impact:** Better resource planning and service delivery

### 4. Leverage Interactive Dashboard for Real-Time Planning  
- **Insight:** Dashboard supports filtering by time, case type, and specialty  
- **Action:** Use in hospital admin teams for ongoing ops monitoring  
- **Impact:** Enables quick decisions and early interventions
