📌 Action: Introduce priority flags and escalation protocols.

💡 Impact: Improves outcomes for working-age chronic patients.

3. Surge in Demand After 2019
📊 Clear spike in monthly waitlists post-2019.

📌 Action: Deploy flexible staffing or pop-up clinics during peak periods.

💡 Impact: Helps absorb surge demand without affecting service levels.

4. Specialty Pressure: Dermatology & Ortho
📉 Consistent high average wait times.

📌 Action: Onboard part-time specialists or cross-utilize capacity.

💡 Impact: Reduces specialty backlog, improves satisfaction.

5. Pediatric Segment (0–15) Is Well-Managed
✅ Lowest average wait times among age groups.

📌 Action: Maintain pediatric priority, reallocate excess capacity to stressed specialties.

💡 Impact: Balances resource use without compromising core care.
